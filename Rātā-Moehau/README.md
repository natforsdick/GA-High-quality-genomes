# Rātā Moehau genomics

This is a [Genomics Aotearoa](https://www.genomics-aotearoa.org.nz/) High-Quality Genomes project for the Aotearoa endemic plant rātā Moehau, *Metrosideros bartlettii*, associated with the manuscript Prebble et al., 'Demographic history and genetic diversity of rātā Moehau (_Metrosideros bartlettii_; Myrtaceae), a critically endangered Aotearoa New Zealand endemic tree', in prep.

Project collaborators: Jessie Prebble, Thomas Buckley, Natalie Forsdick, Duckchul Park, together with Indigenous partners Ngāti Kuri.

Affiliation: [Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research](https://landcareresearch.co.nz/)

Data types: ONT long-read data, Illumina short-read data, Omni-C data to come

Outputs: Reference genome assembly and annotation, species-wide SNPs for demographic history and genetic diversity analyses.

Date started: Conversations with Ngāti Kuri about working on *Metrosideros* spp. began Nov 2020, samples collected Nov 2021.

Publications and outputs: In prep.
