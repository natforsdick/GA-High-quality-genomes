# Genome assembly

We initially tested genome assembly using FLYE and Raven, before trying Shasta which produced the highest quality output for our data. 

Here we provide the `shasta.config` file used for assembly as an example. Shasta may have updated since we used this, so we advise you to check the latest release for details.
