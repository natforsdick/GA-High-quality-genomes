# ONT sequencing of Corynocarpus rupestris

## Collection
Samples of Corynocarpus cribbianus and C. rupestris were collected from the Auckland Botanical Gardens on 21/03/2024 with the help of Ella Rawcliffe.

## Accession numbers

Corynocarpus cribbianus - ABG 11421-19912517
Corynocarpus rupestris -  ABG 11451-19912514 (To be Sequenced)

## DNA Extraction and sequencing
Lab work was done by Elena Hilario. ~10g of leaves were homogenized in liquid nitrogen and the nuclei were isolated. DNA was extracted from the nuclei using 2% CTAB. The ngDNA was cleaned using AXP beads and visualized on an agarose gel. DNA looked intact. 

## ONT sequencing
An ONT library was prepared by Ignacio Carvajal using the LSK114 kit. The Long Fragment Buffer was used for the post-ligation cleanup.
